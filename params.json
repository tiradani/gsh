So far only tested on SL5 and Fedora 16.\r\n\r\n* Python version 2.4 or greater\r\n\r\n* libxml2 and the python bindings for libxml2\r\n\r\n* Globus command line client tools.  Specifically, globusrun, globus-job-run and\r\n  globus-url-copy\r\n\r\n* valid credentials in place for remote gatekeeper access.

Once in the gsh shell, use \"setsite\" to set the gatekeeper\r\nfqdn.  \"setsite\" can also be used to switch gatekeeper fqdns.\r\n\r\nFor more help, once in the gsh shell, run \"help\".\r\n","tagline":"gsh stands for \"grid shell\".
