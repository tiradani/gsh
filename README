gsh stands for "grid shell".  It is a wrapper around globus-job-run commands
that fakes a command line console for a remote gatekeeper.

Prerequisites:

* Linux Operating system.  So far only tested on SL5 and Fedora 16.

* Python version 2.4 or greater

* libxml2 and the python bindings for libxml2

* Globus command line client tools.  Specifically, globusrun, globus-job-run and
  globus-url-copy

* valid credentials in place for remote gatekeeper access.  (e.g. run 
  voms-proxy-init prior to starting gsh

Basic usage:

gsh [-v, --version] [remote gatekeeper fqdn]

If you include the "-v" or "--version" arguments gsh will print its version and
exit whether or not the remote gatekeeper fqdn is included.

Generally, you'll want to start gsh with a gatekeeper fqdn, but gsh can be 
started without one.  Once in the gsh shell, use "setsite" to set the gatekeeper
fqdn.  "setsite" can also be used to switch gatekeeper fqdns.

For more help, once in the gsh shell, run "help".
